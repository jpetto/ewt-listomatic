### Installation

*Only tested on OS X*.

If you get it working on Windows, you should make an instruction file and
submit a pull request!

+1. Clone or unzip this repository into your chosen directory
+2. Open a terminal to said directory and type `npm install` (this will create a *large* `node_modules` directory)
+2.5. (Windows only) In the terminal window type 'npm install -g gulp'. This allows the CLI to access gulp
+3. Add the URL to your firebase account "var base = Rebase.createClass('YOUR URL HERE');" in ListManager.js
+4. Type `gulp` - the app should open in your default browser
